# Theory
Hi All

I’m exited to present a theory Ive been working on for a while, regarding Abstract objects, (examples: Ugliness, beauty, numbers, geometrical objects).

I would be more than happy to get any kind of feedback or help any one who is interested.

The full article is bellow (theory.pdf), but here is a quick summary of what its about:

1. What is an abstract object according to the theory?  how is this explanation different from other existing explanations?

An abstract  object (AO) is essentially a linguistic form that competes with a sentence, which  manages to possess a few important attributes that nouns usually possess, especially the capability of blending into sentences. We use AO when we want to embed a content of a sentence within other sentences. Existing explanations, on the other hand, sees AO’s as an instance that lives outside of the concrete physical world, there is also some common practice that Abstract has to do with generalization. 

2. What is my main criticism with the current explanations?
The current explanations seem to give limited explanations to why AO play practical and usefully rolls in humans daily life’s, especially when it comes using AO from advanced mathematics (for example Multi dimensional objects) , I also think that the current explanation for why ordinary humans find them unintuitive, is problematic and limited. 

3. A brief demonstration of a sentence vs an AO

“Sam is Ugly” vs. “Sam’s Ugliness” is a good example of presenting some thing as a sentence vs as AO,   From the theory’s stand point “Sam’s Ugliness” is just as abstract as just “Ugliness” (which is more known to be abstract), although the theory gives an explanation of why its easier to drop “Sam” in the AO than in the sentence. Notice that its easy to embed “Sam’s Ugliness” into “Sam’s Ugliness is caused due to his small ears” while this expression : “ Sam is Ugly is caused due to his small ear”, won’t sound right.

4. What is the main difference between a sentence and an AO?

The main difference lies in the state of mind while expressing them. A major claim that the theory expresses, is that a sentence's  structure and features results from how we preserve the world, as consists of an independent objective reality, which affects our thoughts, I.e we are realists. An AO however, is a form that while expressing it, we chose, for a short period to refrain from our realist perception, and use a capability that I like to call “solipsism capability”. Its possible to get a hint of this difference when looking into how sentences / AO are structured, a sentence structure like “Sam is Ugly” emphasizes that “Sam” is an independent component, that “is ugly” is dependent on (which is aligned with our realist belief of opinions that are dependent of objects). On the other hand “Sam’s ugliness” emphasize a structure of an intendant component that is attributed to what I think, and a dependent component, “Sam” that is referred to some one in reality.

5. Why do we need to hold different perception of reality when we are creating AO’s?

The theory emphasizes that a sentence is a demanding linguistic form that is intended to give, using different techniques a feeling that its content is real / realistic  (for example, pointing to an object, “this / that” while expressing it). This additional demanding effort which is eventually resulted from our realism perception, is the reason why we we find it hard to embed sentences within other sentences. Creating AO is trick, where we embrace solipsist point of view, for just a quick moment, in order to avoid the effort a sentence require.
