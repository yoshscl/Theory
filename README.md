My fun hobby

This Reppo is for my fun philosophical hobby, in which i express what i believe is to be an "Abstract Object"
As far as i understand, the philosophical conception, of what is an abstract object started around the early 20th century, mainly through the 
great work of Goutlob Frege, a great introduction to what is currently the common explanation is reflected in here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/

However my Views this type of explanation of explanation as problematic, and has a different explanation to the nature of abstract objects
